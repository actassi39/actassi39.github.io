    <h1><center>Suzume's Locking Up
        <br><img src="suzume tojinari.webp" width="50%"></br></center></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><br>In a small coastal town in Miyazaki, Suzume Iwato dreams of her mother giving her a broken chair in a magical world. One morning, she encounters a young man searching for abandoned places in the area. She tells him about an old onsen resort, and they separate. Suzume, thinking she has met him before, heads there as well. However, she finds a door instead. After opening it, she finds the world in her dream, but cannot enter it. When she tries again, she trips into a keystone. When she picks it up, it turns into a kitten and runs off. Confused and frightened, she leaves and returns to school.</p>

    <p><br>During lunch, Suzume notices smoke from the resort before a small earthquake happens. When she looks again, the smoke is now a trailing red column. Worried, she rushes to the resort to find smoke coming out from the door, and the young man trying to close it. Seeing his struggle, Suzume rushes to help him, the smoke gets pulled down, causing a massive earthquake. He then tries to close the door again, but despite his protests, Suzume helps him anyway. Then, after hearing conversations from the resort's heyday, they manage to close the door, and the man locks the door with the key from his neck. After this, the red column disappears, and it rains briefly. Suzume takes the man home, and he introduces himself as Sōta Munakata. He tells Suzume that he has to find and lock doors in abandoned places to prevent "worms" from the magical world from causing earthquakes. A cat then appears, and turns Sōta into the child's chair he was sitting on. Enraged, chair Sōta chases the cat, followed by Suzume. She chases them to a ferry headed to Ehime, but he escapes onto another boat, stranding them. That night, Tamaki, her aunt, demands her to come back, but Suzume hangs up. Sōta then tells her the cat was once a keystone, and the worms were released after its removal.</p>
        
    <p><br>They arrive at Ehime. Using clues from locals who photographed and named the cat "Daijin", they follow the cat. Suzume asks a girl, Chika, if she's seen Daijin, but an earthquake cuts them off. Seeing a worm emerging, Suzume rushes off, and Chika offers a ride on her scooter. They arrive at an abandoned school, and Suzume runs in. Sōta fails to close the door by himself, and his key gets blown off. Suzume then picks it up. Needing her help, Sōta tells Suzume to imagine the school's heyday, and they successfully lock the door, exorcising the worm. The next morning, after staying at Chika's family's inn, and becoming friends with her, they part ways.</p>
        
    <p><br>During a storm while going to their next destination, Suzume and Sōta take shelter at a bus stop. However, a woman named Rumi pulls over and gives them a ride. During a pit stop, Rumi points out the abandoned amusement park near the town. Suzume volunteers to babysit her twins when Rumi has to work, and Sōta helps her. When the twins fall asleep, Suzume helps Rumi at her hostess bar, when she notices Daijin. While she and Sōta chases him, a new worm appears, but Sōta splits up to chase the cat. Suzume finds the doorway attached to a Ferris wheel gondola, but Sōta accidentally activates the ride, and Suzume enters the gondola after seeing the dream world. Meanwhile, Sōta demands Daijin to turn back into a keystone, but he refuses, wanting to "play" with Suzume. Suzume, after being helped by Sōta, then locks the door. In the gondola, Suzume tells Sōta about the dream world and her mother. As they sleep, it is shown that Sōta is losing his sense of self in his chair form, while in Miyazaki, Tamaki decides to bring Suzume back herself after getting advice from Minoru, Tamaki's coworker.</p>
        
    <P><br>The next day, Suzume and Sōta go to Sōta's apartment in Tokyo. There, he tells her the myth of Namazu and that the central keystone is in Tokyo, that it is missing, and that if Tokyo's worm appears, Japan will be destroyed. His family makes sure the doors remain locked, and he took on the burden from his hospitalized grandfather. However, they do not know where Tokyo's doorway is. Then, Sōta's friend, Tomoyo Serizawa, after knocking on the room's door, tells Suzume to let Sōta know he wants to speak with him, but Suzume sees a worm nearby. She runs out, and Sōta chases Daijin after seeing him again, but Daijin says Sōta has to become the new keystone to stop the worm. After finding the worm, Sōta thanks Suzume, and climbs onto it. Suzume follows him, and they make it to the top of the worm. At the top, Sōta turns into a keystone in Suzume's hands, and Suzume begs him to come back as the worm begins to fall. As the resulting earthquake will kill many people, Suzume tearfully puts the keystone down. Suzume then wakes up in a cave, where she finds Tokyo's doorway. In the dream world, she sees keystone Sōta and tries to save him, but fails to. Despite Suzume's pleas, Daijin says it is impossible to save Sōta. Undeterred, Suzume asks Sōta's hospitalized grandfather, Hitsujirō, for help, but he says the same. Angrily, Suzume says she will enter the dream world and save him. Realizing she has been there before, Hitsujirō says that to enter, she must find the first doorway she entered from.</P>
        
    <p><br>Suzume begins her journey to her hometown in Tōhoku, which was destroyed in the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami. Serizawa tells her she can use his car to find Sōta, but Tamaki appears and demands Suzume come home with her. When she refuses, Tamaki decides to join her, but Suzume doesn't say her reasons for leaving. Daijin also silently accompanies the three as well. When Serizawa's car breaks down, they pull over at a rest stop. Tamaki suggests taking the bus to Tokyo she learned about from Minoru, but Suzume refuses, angrily saying that Tamaki is not her mother. Distraught, Tamaki tells Suzume she regrets raising her. After Daijin hisses, Suzume realizes that Tamaki is being possessed by Sadaijin, the black cat. Tamaki, now unpossessed but regretful, runs back to the rest stop. The next morning, they continue driving, but Serizawa crashes his car after hearing the cats speak. Suzume then runs ahead, and Tamaki catches up on an old bike. She rides behind Tamaki, and tells her the cats' true nature. Glad that her niece trusts her, the two reconcile. When they arrive, she finds a page from her old diary about the doorway in a time capsule. At the doorway, Suzume successfully enters after telling Tamaki she will save the one she loves.</p>
        
    <p><br>The world is overrun with worms. Sōta, in stasis, reminisces about Suzume. However, upon hearing her voice, he reaches out, and she pulls him. No longer the keystone, he returns to his human form. However, Daijin returns to being a keystone as a result. To stop the worms, Sōta makes a prayer, and brings back echoes of Suzume's hometown. Sadaijin then also turns to stone. With two keystones in hand, Suzume and Sōta seal the worms and bring peace to the dream world. Sōta then notices a child, Suzume from 12 years ago, and Suzume remembers the first time she entered the dream world. Taking the chair, she rushes to her younger self, who confuses her older self for her mother. Suzume tells her she's not her mother, making both Suzumes break down. She gives the chair to young Suzume, and tells her about her future. Young Suzume asks her who she is, and she replies, "The Suzume of tomorrow." Young Suzume leaves the dream world, followed by Suzume and Sōta. Sōta returns to Tokyo, and Suzume returns to Kyushu with Tamaki, visiting her new friends on the way. Later, Suzume is on her way to school when she sees Sōta walking up the road they first met.</p>

            <p>High school girl Mitsuha Miyamizu lives in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous Hida region. She is bored with the country life, and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins switching bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.

            <p>One day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the shrine on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god who rules human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about a comet expected to pass Earth on the day of her town festival.

He decides to visit Itomori, but does not know its name, his memories of it are fading, and Mitsuha's messages have disappeared. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two, the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers the date of the disaster, realizing their timelines were separated by three years.</p>

Through a vision, Taki discovers that Mitsuha, having fallen in love with him, met his past self while trying to meet him personally. He wakes in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces his identity, and tells him the body switching is part of the Miyamizu family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends Katsuhiko Teshigawara and Sayaka Natori to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a false emergency alert, but the plan fails. He realizes that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine and goes back to find her.</p>

            <p>High-school freshman Hodaka Morishima runs away from his home and moves to Tokyo. On the trip, he almost gets thrown off a ferry when a freak rainstorm hits it. However, he is saved by a man named Keisuke Suga, who gives Hodaka his business card in case he ever needed help. In Tokyo, he struggles to support himself because he is unable to work legally due to his status as a runaway minor. After being kicked out of a lift lobby that he had been using as a shelter, he finds a gun inside a trash bin and then keeps it as a lucky charm, thinking that it was only a toy. He briefly encounters Hina at a fast-food restaurant where she works at. She takes pity on Hodaka, giving him a free meal. Hodaka contacts Suga and is hired as an assistant to his small publishing company. At work, Hodaka meets Natsumi, Suga's niece who Hodaka mistakes as his mistress.They investigate urban legends relating to the unusual weather in Tokyo; from a psychic, they hear the legend of a 'sunshine girl' and a 'rain girl'—a girl who can control the weather.

            <p>On a rainy day, Hodaka watches as Hina is being intimidated into working at a sketchy club and attempts to rescue her. They then run away and the club host pursues them. He becomes pinned down by the club host, but manages to shock him by firing the gun he had found earlier. The two teens escape to a nearby abandoned building where she chides him for interfering, explaining that she needed the job to support herself and her sibling after being fired from her previous job at the fast food restaurant. However, she warms up to him and proceeds to demonstrate her ability to clear the sky by praying. Inspired by the idea of 'sunshine girl', Hodaka visits Hina at her home and proposes that they start a business together; Hina would provide her mysterious ability to people who want clear weather for special events. Their business becomes a great success and they attract a large number of clients ranging from kindergarten students to corporate giants. He also meets with Hodaka's younger brother Nagi at Hina's home. Suga and Natsumi continue to investigate urban legends surrounding the mysterious girl who can change the weather. They visit a priest who tells them a legend of a weather maiden whose power comes at a great price.

An officer informs Hina that social services will be called in to take away Nagi, Hina's younger brother, because they are minors with no legal guardian. Once the police officers left, Hodaka visits Suga in his car, who fires him from his job and gives him severance pay. Suga apologizes for his inability to help Hodaka any further because he doesn't want any complications that could deter his filing for custody for his daughter.</p>

Kanae Sumida, a classmate of Takaki, has been in love with him ever since meeting him in junior high school but has never had the courage to confess her feelings. She tries to spend time with him, waiting long after school for the chance to travel home together. However, Takaki appears ignorant to Kanae's feelings and only treats her as a good friend. Kanae observes that Takaki is always writing emails to someone or staring off into the distance as if searching for something far away. It is later shown that Takaki's emails are not being sent to anyone, and that he has had recurring dreams which feature Akari.

    <p> <h4>Makoto Shinkai (新海 誠 Shinkai Makoto), lahir sebagai Makoto Niitsu (新津 誠 Niitsu Makoto, lahir 9 Februari 1973) merupakan seorang sutradara anime dan mantan perancang grafis yang berasal dari Jepang. Shinkai berasal dari Prefektur Nagano. Shinkai mempelajari sastra Jepang di Universitas Chuo dimana dia menjadi anggota dari klub sastra remaja. Dia mewujudkan keinginannya semasa sekolah untuk membuat manga, anime, dan novel. Anime favoritnya adalah Castle in the Sky oleh Hayao Miyazaki. Shinkai sering mendapat sebutan sebagai "Miyazaki Baru", tetapi ia sendiri menyebut perbandingan ini merupakan sesuatu yang berlebihan.</p>
    </h4>
    <h2><hr>Karier</hr></h2>
    <br><h4><p>Setelah lulus dari Universitas Chuo pada tahun 1994, ia mendapat pekerjaan di Falcom, perusahaan permainan video tempat ia bekerja selama 5 tahun dengan membuat video klip untuk permainan dan desain grafis termasuk konten web. Dalam periode ini, ia bertemu dengan musisi Tenmon yang kemudian akan berkolaborasi dalam beberapa film yang dibuatnya.</p>

    <p>Pada tahun 1999, Shinkai merilis She and Her Cat, animasi pendek berdurasi lima menit yang dibuat dalam monokrom. Animasi ini memenangkan beberapa penghargaan, termasuk grand prize pada kontes DoGA CG Animation tahun 2000. Animasi ini bercerita tentang kehidupan seekor kucing, seluruhnya dari sudut pandang kucing, dalam melewati waktu bersama pemiliknya, seorang wanita muda.</p>
    
    <p>Setelah memenangkan grand prize, Shinkai melanjutkan pekerjaannya di Falcom. Beberapa bulan kemudian pada bulan Juni 2000, Shinkai terinspirasi untuk memulai <a href="http://51.79.160.87/bioskop/voices-distant-star-2002/"><i style="color: #0000ff;">Voices of a Distant Star</i></a> dengan menggambar seorang gadis di kokpit menggenggam ponsel. Beberapa waktu kemudian, ia dihubungi oleh Mangazoo, yang menawarkan untuk "bekerja sama," menawarinya kesempatan untuk mengubah idenya menjadi sebuah anime yang dapat mereka jual. Pada Mei 2001, ia berhenti dari pekerjaannya di Falcom dan mulai bekerja pada Voices. Dalam sebuah wawancara, Shinkai mencatat bahwa produksinya membutuhkan waktu sekitar tujuh bulan.</p>
    
    <p>Voices of a Distant Star diikuti dengan produksi film anime berdurasi 90 menit berjudul<a href="http://51.79.226.154/place-promised-early-days-2004/"> <i style="color: #0000ff;">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</i></a>, yang dirilis secara nasional di Jepang pada tanggal 20 November 2004. Film ini memenangkan banyak penghargaan. Proyek Shinkai berikutnya berjudul <a href="https://kusonime.com/byousoku-5-centimeter-subtitle-indonesia-9/"><i style="color: #0000ff;">5 Centimeters per Second</i></a> yang tayang perdana pada 3 Maret 2007. Film ini terdiri dari tiga film pendek yang berjudul Cherry Blossom, Cosmonaut, dan 5 Centimeters Per Second. Total durasi film ini adalah 63 menit. Pada bulan September 2007, surat kabar terkemuka di Nagano, Shinano Mainichi Shinbun, merilis sebuah iklan TV animasi oleh Makoto Shinkai. Selain dari proyek-proyek sendiri, Shinkai juga membantu dalam animasi film pembuka novel visual untuk Minori, sebuah perusahaan yang memproduksi novel visual.</p>
    
    <p>Shinkai menghabiskan tahun 2008 di London, beristirahat sejak selesainya 5 Centimeters per Second. Ia kembali ke Jepang pada tahun 2009 untuk mulai mengerjakan proyek berikutnya. Ia merilis dua gambar konsep untuk film ini pada bulan Desember 2009. Shinkai menyatakan bahwa film ini akan menjadi yang terpanjang dari film-film animasi yang ia produksi dan menggambarkan cerita yang "hidup" dengan petualangan, aksi, dan asmara berpusat pada seorang gadis yang ceria dan bersemangat dalam sebuah perjalanan untuk mengucapkan "selamat tinggal". Pada November 2010, dia mengungkapkan bahwa pekerjaan berikutnya akan berjudul<a href="http://104.237.198.198/nonton-children-who-chase-lost-voices-sub-indo/"><i style="color: #0000ff;"> Children Who Chase Lost Voices</i></a> from Deep Below. Film ini dirilis pada tanggal 7 Mei 2011. Film berikutnya, <a href="https://kusonime.com/kotonoha-niwa-sub-indo/"><i style="color: #0000ff;">Kotonoha no Niwa</i></a> dirilis pada 31 Mei 2013. Film berikutnya, <a href="https://kusonime.com/movie-kimi-no-na-wa-bd-subtitle-indonesia/"><i style="color: #0000ff;">Kimi no Na wa</a></i> dirilis pada tanggal 26 Agustus 2016. Film terbarunya <a href="https://kusonime.com/tenkinoko-subtitle-indonesia/"><i style="color: #0000ff;">Weathering With You</style></i></a> dirilis pada tanggal 19 Juli 2019.</p>

There he encounters Yukari Yukino, a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a poem, leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.</p>

Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears and be able to "walk" again. However, Yukari quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her poem, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.</p>

<hr>
<p>A schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine (Mika Shinohara (original Japanese), Sumi Mutoh (Japanese) Cynthia Martinez (English)) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of aliens called the Tarsians—named after the Tharsis region of Mars where they were first encountered. As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a giant robotic mecha called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier Lysithea. When the Lysithea leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians, Mikako's friend Noboru Terao (Makoto Shinkai (original Japanese), Chihiro Suzuki (Japanese) Adam Colon (English)) remains on Earth. The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones. As the Lysithea travels deeper into space, messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years.</p>
<p>The narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet. She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius Solar System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject "I am here", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him.</p>

<p>In the manga, 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru himself has joined the UN, which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again.</p>
